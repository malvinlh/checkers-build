# Checkers Game Made by Unity
Playable checkers game (created as the second training for 2023 Schematics NLC Game Development staff). Go to [https://malvinlh.github.io/checkers-build/](https://malvinlh.github.io/checkers-build/) to play the game.

The rules of the game:
1. Black pieces always go first.
2. Each piece may move forward diagonally either one space (if the space is empty), or two spaces (if the adjacent space is occupied by an opponent's piece, and the space beyond it is empty). If a piece jumps over an opposing piece, that piece is captured and removed from the board.
3. If there is an opponent's piece that can be captured, the current player must capture that piece.
4. If a piece manages to capture an opponent's piece, the player gets an additional turn. The player's turn will change if the player is unable to capture an opponent's piece.
5. A normal piece becomes a king piece when it reaches the end of the enemy's board. The identity of a king piece is indicated by a change in the color of the inner circle of the piece to white. King pieces can move diagonally forward or backward.
